# jsconf2019-special

![screenshot displaying the very yellow berlin.js website - because yellow is
the color of javascript. Or something haha](./assets/screenshot.png)

- Date: May 30, 2019
- Time: 18:00 / 6 PM
- Location: co.up, 3rd floor.
- Meetup link: https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-JS/events/261385945/
- After Meetup: TBD - We're coordinating with CSSConf EU!

Rough idea: We want to have a meetup where we bring people together who are in
town for JSConf EU to mix and mingle with the BerlinJS community. Ideally we get some talks from speakers / rejected speakers from their pool. Think of it as a super mini, low-key Reject.JS

## Contributing
All speaker data is in `./speakers.json`. Time and date are at the top of
`index.js`.
```sh
$ npm install     # install dependencies
$ npm start       # start the dev server & open the application
$ npm run build   # output to static files in dist/
$ npm run publish # builds page and publishes it to gh-pages
```
