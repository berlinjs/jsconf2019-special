                  The Node.js Event Loop: Not So Single Threaded
                </h3>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy mt0">
                  You've probably heard, and possibly lamented, that Node.js is single threaded.
                  It's true that all JavaScript executed by Node.js is run in a single thread. This
                  means each JavScript file you write, module you require, and even Node.js itself,
                  all contend for processing time. But JavaScript isn't the only code in Node.js.
                  There's also a lot of C++, most important of which is the event loop. One of the
                  event loops responsibilities is to manage a set of threads called the thread pool.
                  As it turns out, most C++ code in Node.js is multithreaded! Come learn how the
                  event loop works in detail, how it affects the performance of your app, and how
                  you can use this knowledge to your advantage!

                <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy mt0">
                  At a coding bootcamp, you have 3 months to go from zero to dev. Without feeling
                  empowered by a culture of psychological safety to ask all the questions, make
                  mistakes, and sometimes fail hard, you would never learn what you needed in the
                  time given. Imagine if all of the spaces we inhabit as coders throughout our
                  careers - the communities we're part of, the companies we work at, the teams we’re
                  on - offered this environment? How much more would we learn and contribute? This
                  talk offers insight from my time at Founders & Coders: how we achieved this
                  culture; what we did right and wrong; how you can translate our cohort's
                  experiences into actions; and how deliberately building a culture of psychological
                  safety can improve the communities, teams, and companies you’re a part of.

                  Frontend Application Bundles, the Docker of Frontend
                </h3>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy mt0">
                  Frontend apps are on the cusp of a revolution—React is about to launch a streaming
                  server renderer that massively improves performance on both low-end and high-end
                  devices. It's a new dawn for performance & accessibility, but raises another
                  question? How should we host the server component? Can we do that without vendor
                  lock-in? Enter FABs (Frontend Application Bundles), a portable, compact,
                  immutable, server-side JS format that lets you deploy anything from static sites
                  or Next.js to full custom server-rendered React apps anywhere that can run JS,
                  like Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge, Now, etc. Finally, we can have a toolchain
                  that supports the full breadth of frontend projects & server environments, without
                  locking everything to a single host. My talk aims to draw parallels between the
                  server world of a decade ago & the frontend world of today. In the past, companies
                  like AWS & Heroku were innovating & offering exciting new products, but users had
                  to make a choice of which one to use and lock-in their development to target that
                  platform. Today, it's exciting offerings from platforms like Now and Netlify, but
                  all their innovation is locked down inside their ecosystem. Docker changed that in
                  a profound way, and FABs are poised to do the same thing. So this talk is a
                  prediction of the future—that with React's new streaming renderer, a lot more
                  companies will be looking to add a server-side component, and a standard,
                  interoperable bundle format like FABs makes that much more accessible.

                  You Don't Know Your Dependencies
                </h3>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy mt0">
                  If you’re building applications chances are your dependency tree is in the order
                  of hundreds. That can easily scale up to at least a thousand for large
                  applications (like popular OS projects Ghost or Keystone). Join me in my hindered
                  journey to address a big elephant in the room: managing dependencies. Updating a
                  dependency or following common practices shouldn’t have to be a mysterious thing.
                  What’s the right thing to do in your package.json? Exact versions? Using a caret?
                  What’s the reason behind lockfiles? What type of tooling is out there? I’ll
                  present answers from my research to these common questions.
